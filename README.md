# KNNClassifier

This repository is to understand commonly used K-Nearest Neigbor algorithm. 
KNN algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm which we use to deal with both classification and regression problems. 
It's rather easy to implement and but it has a disadvantage of slowing down as the size of data grows. 
In this specific KNNClassifier repository, we test our data with different k values to display different accuracy scores and determine the best accuracy score. 
Train and test files used in the code can be found in the repository.
